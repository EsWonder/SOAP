# SOAP Hello World Project

This project demonstrates a simple SOAP web service implemented in PHP. It includes a server (`soap-server.php`) and a client (`test-soap.php`) that interacts with the server to perform basic SOAP operations. The project is containerized using Docker to simplify deployment and execution.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Docker (for containers)
- Docker Compose (if using a multi-container setup)

## Project Description

The server exposes a `sayHello` function that takes a name and returns a greeting message. The client sends a request to the server and receives the response.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP 8.1 (CLI)**
- **Docker**
